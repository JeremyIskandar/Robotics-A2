# Collision Detection
This script runs a demonstration of the system detecting a cube as an object that would cause a collision. An error message is generated in this instance and the robot is stopped.

## Notes
* `RectangularPrism` is generated
* `faces,vertex,faceNormals` are passed into the `IsCollision` function
* If `collision` is true, then an error message is generated
