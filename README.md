## Project Title: DoBotany
Our group members are:
* Jeremy Iskandar -13226853
* Joshua Siwan -13199955
* Nathan Rees -13225180

## Requirements
* Matlab GUI with advanced "teach" function and displaying individual joint movements and Cartesian [x,y,z] movements
* Functional e-stop that stops operations and permits resuming once disengaged
* Simulated environment with safety hardware
* Safety functionality, including:
	- reacting to e-stop (and resuming once hazard is cleared)
	- preventing collisions with a simulated object is placed in system path (and resuming once hazard is cleared)
	- retreating from simulated safety symbol using visual servoing and RMRC
