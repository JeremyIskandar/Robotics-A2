* Pupose of robot is to automatically water indoor plants
* Provides a solution to a tedious and repetitive manual task

## Features
* Robot can be integrated with soil moisture sensor to further automate the process and water specific plants when they need it
* User-friendly GUI enables operator to have full control over robot's movements and automated processes

## Safety Considerations
* E-stop immediately stops robot movement until user resumes operations
* Collision detection system alerts user via an error message if a foreign object will cause a collision with the robot
* Light curtain will alert user if a foreign object enters the workspace and immediately stop the robot movement
* Visual servoing allows the robot to safely retreat from a recognised symbol
